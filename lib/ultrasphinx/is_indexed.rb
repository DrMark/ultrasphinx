The is_indexed method configures a model for indexing. Its parameters help generate SQL queries for Sphinx.

= Options

== Including regular fields

Use the <tt>:fields</tt> key.

Accepts an array of field names or field hashes. 
  :fields => [
    'created_at', 
    'title', 
    {:field => 'body', :as => 'description'},
    {:field => 'user_category', :facet => true, :as => 'category' }
  ]
  
To alias a field, pass a hash instead of a string and set the <tt>:as</tt> key. 

To allow faceting support on a text field, also pass a hash and set the <tt>:facet</tt> key to <tt>true</tt>. Faceting is off by default for text fields because there is some indexing overhead associated with it. Faceting is always on for numeric or date fields.

To allow sorting by a text field, also pass a hash and set the <tt>:sortable</tt> key to true. This is turned off by default for the same reason as above. Sorting is always on for numeric or date fields.

To apply an SQL function to a field before it is indexed, use the key <tt>:function_sql</tt>. Pass a string such as <tt>"REPLACE(?, '_', ' ')"</tt>. The table and column name for your field will be interpolated into the first <tt>?</tt> in the string.

Note that <tt>float</tt> fields are supported, but require Sphinx 0.98.

== Requiring conditions

Use the <tt>:conditions</tt> key.

SQL conditions, to scope which records are selected for indexing. Accepts a string. 

  :conditions => "created_at < NOW() AND deleted IS NOT NULL"
  
The <tt>:conditions</tt> key is especially useful if you delete records by marking them deleted rather than removing them from the database.

== Ordering subgroups
 
Use the <tt>:order</tt> key.

An SQL order string.

  :order => 'posts.id ASC'
  


== Including a field from an association

Use the <tt>:include</tt> key.

Accepts an array of hashes. 

  :include => [{:association_name => 'category', :field => 'name', :as => 'category_name'}]

Each should contain an <tt>:association_name</tt> key (the association name for the included model), a <tt>:field</tt> key (the name of the field to include), and an optional <tt>:as</tt> key (what to name the field in the parent). 

<tt>:include</tt> hashes also accept their own <tt>:conditions</tt> key. You can use this  if you need custom WHERE conditions for this particular association (e.g, this JOIN).

The keys <tt>:facet</tt>, <tt>:sortable</tt>, <tt>:class_name</tt>, <tt>:association_sql</tt>, and <tt>:function_sql</tt> are also recognized.

== Concatenating several fields within one record

Use the <tt>:concatenate</tt> key.

Accepts an array of option hashes. 

To concatenate several fields within one record as a combined field, use a regular (or lateral) concatenation. Regular concatenations contain a <tt>:fields</tt> key (again, an array of field names), and a mandatory <tt>:as</tt> key (the name of the result of the concatenation). For example, to concatenate the <tt>title</tt> and <tt>body</tt> into one field called <tt>text</tt>: 
  :concatenate => [{:fields => ['title', 'body'], :as => 'text'}]
  
The keys <tt>:facet</tt>, <tt>:sortable</tt>, <tt>:conditions</tt>, <tt>:function_sql</tt>, <tt>:class_name</tt>, and <tt>:association_sql</tt>, are also recognized.

Lateral concatenations are implemented with CONCAT_WS on MySQL and with a stored procedure on PostgreSQL.

== Concatenating the same field from a set of associated records 

Also use the <tt>:concatenate</tt> key.

To concatenate one field from a set of associated records as a combined field in the parent record, use a group (or vertical) concatenation. A group concatenation should contain an <tt>:association_name</tt> key (the association name for the included model), a <tt>:field</tt> key (the field on the included model to concatenate), and an optional <tt>:as</tt> key (also the name of the result of the concatenation). For example, to concatenate all <tt>Post#body</tt> contents into the parent's <tt>responses</tt> field:
  :concatenate => [{:association_name => 'posts', :field => 'body', :as => 'responses'}]

The keys <tt>:facet</tt>, <tt>:sortable</tt>, <tt>:order</tt>, <tt>:conditions</tt>, <tt>:function_sql</tt>, <tt>:class_name</tt>, and <tt>:association_sql</tt>, are also recognized. 

Vertical concatenations are implemented with GROUP_CONCAT on MySQL and with an aggregate and a stored procedure on PostgreSQL. Note that <tt>:order</tt> is useful if you need to order the grouping so that proximity search works correctly, and <tt>:conditions</tt> are currently ignored if you have <tt>:association_sql</tt> defined.

== Custom joins

<tt>:include</tt> and <tt>:concatenate</tt> accept an <tt>:association_sql</tt> key. You can use this if you need to pass a custom JOIN string, for example, a double JOIN for a <tt>has_many :through</tt>). If <tt>:association_sql</tt> is present, the default JOIN for <tt>belongs_to</tt> will not be generated. 

Also, If you want to include a model that you don't have an actual ActiveRecord association for, you can use <tt>:association_sql</tt> combined with <tt>:class_name</tt> instead of <tt>:association_name</tt>. <tt>:class_name</tt> should be camelcase.

Ultrasphinx is not an object-relational mapper, and the association generation is intended to stay minimal--don't be afraid of <tt>:association_sql</tt>.

== Enabling delta indexing

Use the <tt>:delta</tt> key.

Accepts either <tt>true</tt>, or a hash with a <tt>:field</tt> key.

If you pass <tt>true</tt>, the <tt>updated_at</tt> column will be used for choosing the delta records, if it exists. If it doesn't exist, the entire table will be reindexed at every delta. Example:

  :delta => true

If you need to use a non-default column name, use a hash:
 
  :delta => {:field => 'created_at'}
  
Note that the column type must be time-comparable in the DB. Also note that faceting may return higher counts than actually exist on delta-indexed tables, and that sorting by string columns will not work well. These are both limitations of Sphinx's index merge scheme. You can perhaps mitigate the issues by only searching the main index for facets or sorts:

  Ultrasphinx::Search.new(:query => "query", :indexes => Ultrasphinx::MAIN_INDEX)

The date range of the delta include is set in the <tt>.base</tt> file.

= Examples

== Complex configuration

Here's an example configuration using most of the options, taken from production code:

  class Story < ActiveRecord::Base  
    is_indexed :fields => [
        'title', 
        'published_at',
        {:field => 'author', :facet => true}
      ],
      :include => [
        {:association_name => 'category', :field => 'name', :as => 'category_name'}
      ],      
      :concatenate => [
        {:fields => ['title', 'long_description', 'short_description'], 
          :as => 'editorial'},
        {:association_name => 'pages', :field => 'body', :as => 'body'},
        {:association_name => 'comments', :field => 'body', :as => 'comments', 
          :conditions => "comments.item_type = '#{base_class}'"}
      ],
      :delta => {:field => 'published_at'},
      :conditions => self.live_condition_string
  end  

Note how setting the <tt>:conditions</tt> on Comment is enough to configure a polymorphic <tt>has_many</tt>.

== Association scoping

A common use case is to only search records that belong to a particular parent model. Ultrasphinx configures Sphinx to support a <tt>:filters</tt> element on any date or numeric field, so any <tt>*_id</tt> fields you have will be filterable.

For example, say a Company <tt>has_many :users</tt> and each User <tt>has_many :articles</tt>. If you want to to filter Articles by Company, add <tt>company_id</tt> to the Article's <tt>is_indexed</tt> method. The best way is to grab it from the User association:

  class Article < ActiveRecord::Base 
     is_indexed :include => [{:association_name => 'users', :field => 'company_id'}]
  end
 
Now you can run:

 @search = Ultrasphinx::Search.new('something', 
   :filters => {'company_id' => 493})
 
If the associations weren't just <tt>has_many</tt> and <tt>belongs_to</tt>, you would need to use the <tt>:association_sql</tt> key to set up a custom JOIN.
