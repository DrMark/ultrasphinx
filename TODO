Planned:

* Finish unifying filters and textfields
* Support exclude filters
* Make sure filters can be set to nil
* Geolocation search

Not sure:

* Use Pat Allan's association configurator, possibly with an API change to avoid the message-passing DSL
* Use Treetop for the query parser instead of regexes
